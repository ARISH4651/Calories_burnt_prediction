 Calories Burnt Prediction 

## Overview  
This project builds a **machine learning model** to predict the number of calories burnt during physical activity based on factors such as age, gender, height, weight, duration, heart rate, and body temperature.  

✅ Useful for fitness tracking applications, personalized health recommendations, and workout optimization.

 The best performing model is xgboost with an R² score of 99%.

🔑 Key insights:

Weight and Duration strongly influence calories burnt

Gender has a moderate effect

Age shows a weaker correlation

☑️ This model can be used in fitness apps to estimate calorie burn during workouts.
